# First Project: Portfolio
This is my portfolio website. It is full of placeholders for now. I will update this website as I learn more throughout the bootcamp.

You can view the live demo here: https://floofycato.github.io/Portfolio/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML & CSS

Showcased use of HTML and CSS.

## Lessons Learned:
Trello / Project Management is important in maintaining focus on user stories.

Mobile responsiveness should always be kept in mind when coding.

./ should be the path format so it works with GitHub Page deployment. I will make sure to use this format throughout my image and page links.
